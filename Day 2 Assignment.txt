Theory + Practical Code Based Questions

Question 1: Variable Assignment and Usage
Theory: Explain the process of variable assignment in Python. What rules should be followed while naming a variable?
Practical: Write a Python code to assign the value `10` to a variable named `my_number` and then print the value of `my_number`.

Question 2: Understanding Data Types
Theory: Describe the difference between integers and floating-point numbers in Python.
Practical: Create two variables, `whole_number` assigned with an integer and `decimal_number` assigned with a floating-point number. Print their values.

Question 3: Strings in Python
Theory: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a character?
Practical: Define a string variable named `greeting` with the value `"Hello, world!"`. Print the variable value.

Question 4: Single-line and Multi-line Comments
Theory: Explain the purpose of comments in Python and differentiate between single-line and multi-line comments.
Practical: Write a Python code snippet that includes both a single-line comment and a multi-line comment.
