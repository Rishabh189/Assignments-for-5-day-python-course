# Question 2: Understanding Data Types

# Theory: Describe the difference between integers and floating-point numbers in Python.
"""
integer numbers are whole numbers like -4, 0, 5, 6 etc
floating point numbers are decimalpoint numbers like 5.4, 9.0 etc
"""
# Practical: Create two variables, `whole_number` assigned with an integer and `decimal_number` assigned with a floating-point number. 
# Print their values.

whole_number = 6
decimal_number = 10.5
print(whole_number)
print(decimal_number)
