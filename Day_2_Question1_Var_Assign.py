# Question 1: Variable Assignment and Usage

# Theory: Explain the process of variable assignment in Python. What rules should be followed while naming a variable?
"""
Answer: In python,variable can be assigned using '=' operator as shown below,
a= 10 (int type variable)
b = 2.4 (float type variable)
str = "Rishabh" (string type variable)
Also, we do not need to define data typein python, it is implicitly defined.

Rules to be followed while naming a variable :
1- You can not use special symbols #@*&% 
2- Only underscore can be used
3- Number can not be used at starting of variable. However, numbers can be used in between or end of variable name
4- Extra space can not be used

"""
 
# Practical: Write a Python code to assign the value `10` to a variable named `my_number` and then print the value of `my_number`.

my_number = 10
print("value of number is: ",my_number)
